                <h2>Strawberries</h2>
                <p>There is nothing that tastes like summer the same way.
                    They are filled with a longing and in its scent all the summer memories
                    of childhood are gathered together like a string of pearls. Strawberries
                    are happiness - and we should feast on that.</p>
                <!-- <p>If you want a large harvest of strawberries, you need to make sure that

                <h3>Choosing a strawberry variety</h3>
                <p>Remounting, reblooming, varieties flower all season and produce berries for an extended period, in fact sometimes right up to the first frost. One-time bloomers bloom profusely and produce larger yields for a limited period.
                    By growing several different varieties, the strawberry summer can be long. 'Gasana', 'Montana', 'Ostara', 'Ruby Ann' and 'Toscana' are examples of remontant strawberry varieties, and among the one-time bloomers, 'Florence', 'Honeoye', 'Polka' and 'Sonata' produce good berries.</p>

                <h3>Plant site and planting of strawberries</h3>
                <p>Strawberries can either be planted in early spring or in July/August and in both cases start to give a good harvest the following year. They thrive best in a sunny and open location, preferably with a slight south slope for earlier harvest. The soil should preferably be rich in loam and mixed with sand. Clear the land free of weeds before planting and then fertilize heavily with cow manure.
                    Plant the plants with a distance of 30-40 cm and a row distance of at least twice that. Plant the strawberry plants as deep as they were in their pot.</p>

                <h3>Managing your strawberry field</h3>
                <p>Keep clear of weeds between the strawberry plants as they dislike competition for space. Be careful when clearing, do not dig too close to the roots of the plants, they are easily damaged. Feel free to cover the soil in the aisles with straw, wood wool, grass clippings or cover bark, then you will keep the berries clean and healthy while keeping weeds at bay.
                    Water if the early summer is dry, preferably in the morning so the leaves have time to dry up during the day and the risk of disease attack is reduced. In general, one should be careful with watering when the berries have started to ripen to avoid them becoming bad and rotting. Drip irrigation for the strawberry plants solves many of the problems.
                    Fertilize the strawberry field after harvest, then the plants have time to store nutrients for next year's season.</p>

                <h3>After you harvest your strawberries</h3>
                <p>After harvesting, clear away the reef plants that have formed, they can instead be planted in new rows. Every three or four years, the strawberry land should be renewed in order for the harvests to continue to be abundant. The easiest way is to remove the oldest third or fourth of the plants every year and plant new ones. Then choose a new place to avoid diseases.

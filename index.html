                <h3>1. Before planting</h3>
                <p>If you want a large harvest of strawberries, you need to make sure that you buy healthy, new planting material or take reef plants from your own healthy plants. Examples of troublesome ailments that can affect strawberry plants are nematode and virus diseases.</p>

                <h3>2. Choosing a strawberry variety</h3>
                <p>Remounting, reblooming, varieties flower all season and produce berries for an extended period, in fact sometimes right up to the first frost. One-time bloomers bloom profusely and produce larger yields for a limited period.
                </p><p>By growing several different varieties, the strawberry summer can be long. 'Gasana', 'Montana', 'Ostara', 'Ruby Ann' and 'Toscana' are examples of remontant strawberry varieties, and among the one-time bloomers, 'Florence', 'Honeoye', 'Polka' and 'Sonata' produce good berries.</p>

                <h3>3. Plant site and planting of strawberries</h3>
                <p>Strawberries can either be planted in early spring or in July/August and in both cases start to give a good harvest the following year. They thrive best in a sunny and open location, preferably with a slight south slope for earlier harvest. The soil should preferably be rich in loam and mixed with sand. Clear the land free of weeds before planting and then fertilize heavily with cow manure.
                    Plant the plants with a distance of 30-40 cm and a row distance of at least twice that. Plant the strawberry plants as deep as they were in their pot.</p>

                <h3>4. Managing your strawberry field</h3>
                <p>Keep clear of weeds between the strawberry plants as they dislike competition for space. Be careful when clearing, do not dig too close to the roots of the plants, they are easily damaged. Feel free to cover the soil in the aisles with straw, wood wool, grass clippings or cover bark, then you will keep the berries clean and healthy while keeping weeds at bay.
                    </p><p>Water if the early summer is dry, preferably in the morning so the leaves have time to dry up during the day and the risk of disease attack is reduced. In general, one should be careful with watering when the berries have started to ripen to avoid them becoming bad and rotting. Drip irrigation for the strawberry plants solves many of the problems.
                    Fertilize the strawberry field after harvest, then the plants have time to store nutrients for next year's season.</p>

                <h3>5. After you harvest your strawberries</h3>
                <p>After harvesting, clear away the reef plants that have formed, they can instead be planted in new rows. Every three or four years, the strawberry land should be renewed in order for the harvests to continue to be abundant. The easiest way is to remove the oldest third or fourth of the plants every year and plant new ones. Then choose a new place to avoid diseases.

                <h3>1. Growing strawberries in a greenhouse</h3>
                <p>By growing strawberries in a greenhouse, you can enjoy the tasty berries a little earlier in the season. If the spring is warm, the first strawberries can be harvested as early as the end of May in the southern parts of the country.
                </p><p>Strawberry plants grown in greenhouses are planted in July/August in loamy planting soil. The plants overwinter nicely without any extra heat and start to grow, and eventually flower, when the spring sun warms up the greenhouse. It is fine to keep the strawberry plants in the greenhouse even after harvest, alternatively you remove them and plant new ones in late summer. If you choose to clear out the strawberries, the greenhouse can instead be used for other delicacies such as cucumbers and tomatoes. If the plants are left standing, they should be replaced at least every three years to produce good berries.</p>

                <h3>2. Advantages and disadvantages of growing in a greenhouse</h3>
                <p>The difficult thing with strawberries in greenhouses is that the plants require more care with water than those planted outdoors in the garden country. And remember that the flowers must be pollinated to produce berries. Outdoors, this is taken care of, without us thinking about it, by our diligent pollinators. But if the strawberries bloom early, there are not so many bumblebees and bees that are active, plus they may have difficulty finding their way into the greenhouse. Therefore, it may be appropriate to help yourself, use a soft brush and brush carefully from flower to flower.</p>

                <h3>3. But the advantages of growing</h3>
                <p>in a greenhouse wins. The berries are easier to harvest, there will be no attacks by snails, no weeding needs to be done and the berries can be left alone for birds who otherwise like to munch on the berries.
                </p><p>If you choose to plant strawberry plants in ampels or raised boxes, it is an advantage to choose varieties with a hanging habit where the flowers, and eventually the berries, sit on long stems. Then it will be extra easy to pick the berries. Examples of varieties are 'Loran', 'Temptation', 'Toscana' and 'Tristan'. All the varieties are also remontant, i.e. bloom again, and therefore produce berries for a longer period of time, which can be good if the plants are to remain in the greenhouse year after year.</p>

                <h3>4. Care of strawberries in greenhouses</h3>
                <p>Other care is to clear away reef plants as they form, they only steal energy from the main plant. Also cut away wilted leaves and harvested berry stems. Strawberry plants have fairly low nutrient requirements, so it is enough to add half a dose of nutrients to the water a few times during the summer to meet the plants' needs.</p>

Strawberry lovers is a website for an online community who wants to help people be more successful when growing their own strawberries.

This site is not only targeted towards people who are already growing strawberries and want better results but also people who are curious about how to get started. Of course regular strawberry lovers who don't want to grow themselves are also welcome! Perhaps they find this site because of the delicious recipes or they are looking for a fun and friendly community to join.

### Typography

When choosing font it was important to find one that sets the correct tone. Chosen fonts are fun and give an amateur feel. This is not a professional website, it is a fun and friendly community and the font had to reflect that.
- Shantell Sans is used for headings (sans-serif as backup font)
- Bricolage Grotesque is used for paragraphs (sans-serif as backup font)

### Images

Images chosen to either happy people or beautiful strawberries. Also a variety of different types of images was chosen to reflect the big variety of members in the community. All with the intention to elicit a positive response from user.

### Wireframes

Initial wireframes sketch with 2 basic sketch designs.

### Accessiblity

All pages are designed to be responsive to different screen sizes to accomodate users with different preferred devices.
<br>
Semantic HTML is used to aid people with with dissabilities such as visual impairment and  alt text is used for all images so it can be read by screen reader. Semantic HTML also helps with search engines optimization so the correct users can find this site and find it useful.


## Features

### The welcome image

The welcome image is the first thing a new user sees so very important to set the right tone and elicit the right feeling. Chosen image and text creates a welcoming feel and positive emotion.

### The navigation bar

The navigation bar is avalible on every page and always looks the same to make it easier for user to navigate. It is set to sticky position, so it is always visible to the user when scrolling down. This removes the need for any "back to top" buttons.

All links have mouse over effects to give instant feedback to user and indicate that it is a clickable link. Navigation bar links has a border underneath the active one to show user which page is currently displayed.

### The footer

The footer section has a simple design featuring icons to social media sites. Since icons are used instead of text, aria-labels are used so screen readers know what links are for.

### Code

- Some of the code from the Love Running walkthrough project was used and adapted.

- Was inspired by this beautiful project from a fellow classmate, Sarah-Lee Bester, both from code written and also design. Link to project: [Bro-code](https://taalverena.github.io/bro-code/index.html)

- Took inspiration from Kera Cudmore's very comprehensive README guide: [Readme examples.](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples)

- Re-watched this video to make absolute positioning work:

- Re-watched this video to make sticky positioning work:

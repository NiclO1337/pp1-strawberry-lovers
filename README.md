### Code

- Some of the code from the Love Running walkthrough project was used and adapted.

- Was inspired by this beautiful project from a fellow classmate, Sarah-Lee Bester, both from code written and also design. Link to project: [Bro-code](https://taalverena.github.io/bro-code/index.html)

- Took inspiration from Kera Cudmore's very comprehensive README guide: [Readme examples.](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples)


- Re-watched this video to make absolute positioning work:
[Learn CSS Position In 9 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx5jmI0UlXU&t=18s)

- Re-watched this video to make sticky positioning work:

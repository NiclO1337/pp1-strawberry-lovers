![Colour scheme](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmntcacug/image/upload/v1693423544/colour-scheme_lklpsl.jpg)


### Typography

When choosing fonts it was important to find one that sets the correct tone. The chosen fonts are fun and give an amateur feel. This is not a professional website, it is a fun and friendly community and the font had to reflect that.
- Shantell Sans is used for headings (sans-serif as a backup font)
- Bricolage Grotesque is used for paragraphs (sans-serif as a backup font)

### Images

Images were chosen to either show happy people with strawberries or beautiful delicious strawberries. Also, a variety of different types of images was chosen to reflect the wide variety of members in the community. All to elicit a positive response from the user.

### Wireframes

Initial wireframes sketch with 2 basic sketch designs. The final design has many improvements from the initial ideas.

## Features

### The welcome image

The welcome image is the first thing a new user sees so very important to set the right tone and elicit the right feeling. Chosen image and text create a welcoming feel and positive emotion.

### The navigation bar

The navigation bar is available on every page and always looks the same. Consistency makes it easier for users to navigate. Its position is set to sticky, this is so it will always visible to the user when scrolling down. This removes the need for any "back to top" buttons or additional navigation.

### Links

All links have mouse-over effects to give instant feedback to the user and indicate that it is a clickable link. Navigation bar links have a border underneath the active one to show the user which page is currently displayed.

The main content features easy-to-read text divided into categories and sections. Sections are numbered to make it easier to navigate when content splits into 2 columns on larger screens.

### The About Us page

The About Us section is where the user learns more about the community and also features a form where the user is given the option to join as a member. The form has required fields to help users not to forget to input important information. The field for "Favorit seed" is optional because not all users will have their favorite yet.

### The footer

The footer section has a simple design featuring icons for popular social media sites. Since icons are used instead of text, aria labels were added so screen readers can know what links are for.

### Code

- Some of the code from the Love Running walkthrough project was used and adapted.

- I was inspired by this beautiful project by a fellow classmate, Sarah-Lee Bester, both from code writing and design. Link to project: [Bro-code](https://taalverena.github.io/bro-code/index.html)

- Took inspiration from Kera Cudmore's very comprehensive README guide: [Readme examples.](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples)

- Re-watched this video to make absolute positioning work:
[Learn CSS Position In 9 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx5jmI0UlXU&t=18s)

- Re-watched this video to make sticky positioning work:
[The Forgotten CSS Position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzjU1GmKosQ)

- Code .visually-hidden from my discord friend Laura, she is a professional front end developer. My solution of .hidden-heading {display: none;} hides the heading from screen readers too and this professional solution does not. Also my name of class was limited in its uses.

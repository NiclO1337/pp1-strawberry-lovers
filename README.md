### Typography

When choosing font it was important to find one that sets the correct tone. Chosen fonts are fun and give an amateur feel. This is not a professional website, it is a fun and friendly community and the font had to reflect that.
- Shantell Sans is used for headings (sans-serif as backup font)
- Bricolage Grotesque is used for paragraphs (sans-serif as backup font)

Images chosen to either show happy people with strawberries or beautiful delicious strawberries. Also a variety of different types of images was chosen to reflect the big variety of members in the community. All with the intention to elicit a positive response from user.

### Wireframes

Initial wireframes sketch with 2 basic sketch designs. Final design has many improvements from the initial ideas.

The about us section is where the user learns more about the community and also features a form where the user is given the option to join as a member. The form has required fields to help user not to forget to input important information. The field for "Favorit seed" is optional because not all users will have their favorite yet.

### Code

- Some of the code from the Love Running walkthrough project was used and adapted.

- Was inspired by this beautiful project from a fellow classmate, Sarah-Lee Bester, both from code written and also design. Link to project: [Bro-code](https://taalverena.github.io/bro-code/index.html)

- Took inspiration from Kera Cudmore's very comprehensive README guide: [Readme examples.](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples)

- Re-watched this video to make absolute positioning work:
[Learn CSS Position In 9 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx5jmI0UlXU&t=18s)

- Re-watched this video to make sticky positioning work:
[The Forgotten CSS Position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzjU1GmKosQ)

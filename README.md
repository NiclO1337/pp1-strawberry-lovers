# Strawberry lovers

Strawberry lovers is a website for an online community who wants to help people be more successful when growing their own strawberries.

This site is not only targeted towards people who are already growing strawberries and want better results but also people who are curious about how to get started. Of course regular strawberry lovers who don't want to grow themselves are also welcome! Perhaps they find this site because of the delicious recipes or they are looking for a fun and friendly community to join.

### Code

- Some of the code from the Love Running walkthrough project was used and adapted.

- Was inspired by this beautiful project from a fellow classmate, Sarah-Lee Bester, both from code written and also design. Link to project: [Bro-code](https://taalverena.github.io/bro-code/index.html)

- Took inspiration from Kera Cudmore's very comprehensive README guide: [Readme examples.](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples)

- Re-watched this video to make absolute positioning work:
[Learn CSS Position In 9 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx5jmI0UlXU&t=18s)

- Re-watched this video to make sticky positioning work:
